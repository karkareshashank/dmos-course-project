DMOS Course Projects
--------------------

Developed a user-level multi-threading library using the ucontext library.
Added the semaphores to manage the synchronization between the threads.
On the top of these functionality, developed the message passing methods.
Where one thread can send message to a port and other thread can retrive it.
